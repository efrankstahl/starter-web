# Starter Web Project

## Introduction

This is a simple website project for showing how
to use Git and Github together

they're really making me add a whole bunch of stuff one 
piece at a time, when I assure you I 'git' the gist!!!
..or do i?

There is SO MUCH to learn and I do wish I were getting through
these videos a mite faster.

## Purpose

Adding more stuff for the rebase example

## Deployment 

This remains a simple webproject
